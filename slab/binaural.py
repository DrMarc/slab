            azimuth (int | float): azimuth for which the interaural level spectrum is calculated.
            ils (dict): interaural level spectrum to apply.  If None, `make_interaural_level_spectrum()` is called.
            For repeated use, it is better to generate and keep the ils in a variable to avoid re-computing it.
