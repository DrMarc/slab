    A complex spatially extended moving sound is generated ('moving_gaussian'). This stimulus simulates the acoustics of a free-field loudspeaker arc.  A gaussian profile moves from left to right or right to left across the virtual speaker array and the speed of the movement and modulation depth (across space) can be varied. Detection thresholds for motion direction are measured at different motion speeds. Then the effect of adaptation by a long moving adapter at one speed on the detectability of motion at different speeds is measured.

    This experiment showcases complex stimulus generation and staircases, among others.
