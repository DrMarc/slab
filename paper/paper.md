# Summary

Begin your paper with a summary of the high-level functionality of your software for a non-specialist reader. Avoid jargon in this section.
JOSS welcomes submissions from broadly diverse research areas. For this reason, we require that authors include in the paper some sentences that explain the software functionality and domain of use to a non-specialist reader. We also require that authors explain the research applications of the software. The paper should be between 250-1000 words

A summary describing the high-level functionality and purpose of the software for a diverse, non-specialist audience.

# Statement of need

A clear Statement of Need that illustrates the research purpose of the software.
Mention (if applicable) a representative set of past or ongoing research projects using the software and recent scholarly publications enabled by it.
If you want to cite a software repository URL (e.g. something on GitHub without a preferred
citation) then you can do it with the example BibTeX entry below for @fidgit.
For a quick reference, the following citation commands can be used:
- `@author:2001`  ->  "Author et al. (2001)"
- `[@author:2001]` -> "(Author et al., 2001)"
- `[@author1:2001; @author2:2001]` -> "(Author1 et al., 2001; Author2 et al., 2002)"

# Figures

Figures can be included like this:
![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](figure.png)
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Fenced code blocks are rendered with syntax highlighting:
```python
for n in range(10):
    yield f(n)
```
